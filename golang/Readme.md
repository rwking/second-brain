These are my personal notes that I took while working through Jon Bodner's book, [Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Go Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go/9781492077206/). 

I summarized the text and in some cases, copied code examples here. In no way did I intend to violate the author's or publisher's copyright, and all of the material here should be considered protected. I will make this content private or remove it entirely if asked to by the publisher or the author.
